                            At first glance it was unclear what was the initial call to action. We realized that there was a donation button on a rotating carousel. We’ve mistaken it for a banner ad. This button took you to another page, with their paypal information, which a user can then send money to the organization to send a donation.

                                Becoming a sponsor was the next call to action that we identified, which was also located in the carousel. This action took you to a page where they provided PDF forms for a user to download and print at home.

                                        Information on the volunteer page was disorganized and cluttered. The process of signing up to volunteer led a user to a third party site to enter their information and select a committee to participate in.
